10Mhz Time Base oscillator for Philips PM instruments.

This little project is intended for all the owners of Philips "PM66xx" family Frequency Meters and Counters, who need to upgrade or replace one of the following time-base oscillators fitted in those instruments:

_ PM9677
_ PM9678
_ PM9679
_ PM9690

This new PCB respects the original module's connections, dimensions, and mechanical fastening, to garantee a direct replacement without modifications.
It can be equipped with any kind of industrial integrated oscillators in DIL-14 case, either TCXO and VCXO types.

A jumper allow to choose 2 operating modes:

1) "ON/STANDBY" mode: oscillator is always running taking supply from intrument's battery charger to maintain temperature and stability, and the output is state is switched on/off by the main power switch on front panel (Recommended default).
2) "ON/OFF" mode: both oscillator and output are powered from the main power switch (Power saving mode, for portable use in battery supply).
